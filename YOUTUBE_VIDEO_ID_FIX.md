# Mobile Video Controls Fix

## Issue
When viewing the static web app on mobile devices, video controls become magnified and overlay on top of the video content, making it difficult to watch videos properly.

## Root Cause
This issue occurs due to:
1. iOS Safari's handling of embedded video iframes
2. Mobile viewport scaling affecting video control elements
3. Missing mobile-specific CSS for video containers
4. Touch interaction conflicts with iframe content

## Solution

### 1. Mobile-Specific CSS Rules
Added CSS rules to handle mobile video containers:
- Prevent control magnification
- Ensure proper touch handling
- Fix viewport scaling issues
- Improve iframe responsiveness on mobile

### 2. Video Container Improvements
- Added mobile-specific classes for video containers: `mobile-video-container` and `mobile-shorts-container`
- Improved touch interaction handling
- Better responsive design for different screen sizes
- Enhanced iframe positioning for mobile devices

### 3. iOS Safari Specific Fixes
- Added webkit-specific CSS properties
- Improved mobile video player behavior
- Fixed touch event propagation issues
- Added `playsInline` attribute to prevent fullscreen behavior

## Files Modified
- `src/styles/App.css` - Added mobile video control fixes
- `src/pages/Videos.js` - Enhanced mobile video container classes
- `public/index.html` - Updated viewport meta tags for mobile optimization

## Implementation Details
The fix includes:
1. CSS media queries for mobile devices (max-width: 768px)
2. Touch-action properties for better mobile interaction
3. Viewport meta tag optimization: `user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`
4. iOS Safari specific webkit properties (`-webkit-transform`, `-webkit-backface-visibility`)
5. Responsive video container classes (`mobile-video-container`, `mobile-shorts-container`)
6. Hardware acceleration for smoother video playback
